This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This is a small Dapp built with NextJS and EthersJS.
I wrote a small smart contract which simply adds the connected metamask wallet address to a list called 'whitelistedAddresses'.

I will be expanding the project to build a small De-fi Dapp.
Stay tuned.

The Dapp will be deployed through Vercel.
